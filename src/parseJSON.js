// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {
  var at; // keeps track of index position
  var ch; // current character at index

  var next = function () {
    at += 1; // increments index of json
    ch = json.charAt(at); // assigns current char at index of json
    return ch;
  }

};
ch === '{'
object();



// functions needed for booleans, null, undefined, objects, arrays, numbers and strings
